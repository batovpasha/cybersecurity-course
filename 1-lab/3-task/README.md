## Problem

Write a code to attack some simple substitution cipher. To reduce the complexity of this one we will use only uppercase 
letters, so the keyspace is only 26! To get this one right automatically you will probably need to use some sort of 
genetic algorithm (which worked the best last year), simulated annealing or gradient descent. 
Seriously, write it right now, you will need it to decipher the next one as well. 
Bear in mind, there√¢\x80\x99s no spaces. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWywcUIMoGr_cjOMaqjqeSyAyzK93icQE4W-6bDELfQ>
